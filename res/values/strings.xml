as 4 X 4, 5 x 5, 6 x 6.

       Boggle players receive 100 points for each unique three letter word.\n 
       For words over three letters long, players receive 100 points plus 100 additional points for each letter over three. 
       So, for example, a five letter word in Boggle would be worth 300 points. 
       100 points for the first three letters and then 200 points for the fourth and fifth letters. 
       Words less then three letters receive no points in Boggle.

   This is a sample that uses internal sensor to collect data and interact with users.
   You can tilt the phone to find the answer of the math, and by shaking the phone to
   gain more time. These main techniques would be integrated into our final projects once
   our main framework is done.
</string>
<string name="sensorTesting_text">
    This page is mainly doing testing on internal Accelerometer sensor, user can shake the
    phone by the direction of single or multiple axis, and the counter for the shaking motion 
    will increment by 1 respectively. Moreover, flipping the phone downwards and upwards will
    count as 1 flipping. Enjoy...
</string>
<string name="shakeSurvivalAbout_text">\
    <b>Overview:\n</b>
    In the game, there are many space invaders moving upward at every specific time interval. 
    If there are any invaders cross the white line in front of the green cannon, the game is over.
    New wave of invaders comes at every specific time interval.
    The time interval for new invaders becomes smaller and smaller and the invaders move faster and faster at every specific time interval.
    That is to say, the difficulty of the game increases at every specific time interval.
    Moreover, there is a defensive wall behind the alert line, which can kill specific number of space invaders based on its HP.
    Bonus, such as 20 units of energy or a super bomb or 10 units of HP for the defensive wall, will appear near the cannon.
    There are two modes in the game, including survival mode and time mode.\n
    \n
    <b>How to play:</b> \n
    You can kill an invader by tapping your screen once using 2 units of energy.\n
    You can kill a lot of invaders by keeping touching your screen and raising your phone and putting it down
    quickly using 10 units of energy.\n
    You can get 4 units of energy and add 1 unit of HP to the defensive wall by shaking your phone once.\n
    You can get 10 units of energy by flipping your phone downward and then upward once.\n
    You can move the green cannon by slightly tilting your phone left or right.\n 
    \n
    <b>About Survival Mode:</b>\n
    In survival mode, you have to keep killing invaders in order to survive as long as possible.
    The new wave of invaders comes faster and faster and the invaders move faster and faster every 20 seconds.
    And bonus appears every 10 seconds.\n
    \n
    <b>About Time Mode:</b>\n
    In time mode, space invaders move upward faster and new space invaders come faster than survival mode.
    Moreover, you have only 60 seconds to get points as many as possible. If you kill one invader, you can get 10 points.
    Also, if you get a bonus, you can get 30 bonus points.
    The new wave of invaders comes faster and faster and the invaders move faster and faster every 5 seconds.
    And bonus appears every 5 seconds.\n
